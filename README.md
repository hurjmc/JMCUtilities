JMCUtilities
============

A set of Java utility classes for use during Computer Science programming lessons using Java as the target language.

Classes are provided which enable the construction of 'Target' and 'Maze' games. Using the utility classes these two games may be coded using only the basic 
procedural programming constructs:
- Sequence
- Alternation (if - else)
- Iteration (for and while loops)
- Procedural abstraction (methods)

Also provided is a means to read input from the command line without the necessity of dealing with Exceptions.

No knowledge of OO concepts is needed to use these utilities.
